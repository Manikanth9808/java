## Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1: Calculator  
Make a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.  
Input:  
- `a` (double)  
- `b` (double)  
- `operation` (String) â€” what operation to do  

### Problem 2: Odd Numbers List  
Give a number `a`. Print the first `a` odd numbers starting from 1.  
Example:  
Input: 4  
Output: 1 3 5 7  

### Problem 3: Odd Numbers with Condition  
Give a number `a`.  
- If `a` is odd, print the first `a` odd numbers.  
- If `a` is even, print the first `a - 1` odd numbers.  
Example:  
Input: 6  
Output: 1 3 5 7 9  

### Problem 4: Count Multiples  
Given a list of numbers, count how many numbers are divisible by each number from 1 to 9.  
Example:  
Input: [1,2,8,9,12,46,76,82,15,20,30]  
Output: {1=11, 2=8, 3=4, 4=4, 5=3, 6=2, 7=0, 8=1, 9=1}
