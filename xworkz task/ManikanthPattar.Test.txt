1ans) Jre stands for java run time environment it helps to jvm to  execute the code   

	jvm is a helping us to executing the code by 4 for operation 1st provide the runtime environment and load the 	byte code and verify the byte code 	and 	read the byte code stram line by line and display the output. jvm alone cannot do this all .it take helps to jre and library .jvm and 	library is inside the jre 

	jdk stands for java development kit it contains jre and development tools (javac ext..)

2ans) to provide runtime environment
	loads the byte code
	verify the byte code
	read the byte code stream line by line and display the console output

3ans) java is a platform independent because we can use bytecode any operating system and code  can share and run  any platform means window mac ext..

4ans) class is group  of objects methods functions and also it is non primitive data type

8ans) class variable is used to variable declare and initialization inside the main method or we can use outide the main method with using static keyword 


9ans) the data type is used to represents type of data in variable/areas
 there are two data types are there: 1.primitive datatype 2.non primitive data types
   primitive data types:  
there are byte,short,int,long,float,double,Boolean,char

non primitive datatypes:
String,System..

10ans)main method is used to write a syntax static and Symantic code in java 


11ans)

class Check{
public static void main(String[] args){
int a=9;

if(a%2==0){
System.out.println("the given number is even");
else{
System.out.println("the given number is odd");
}
}
